        <p>Aslan was the true King of Narnia who at the first moments spoke the words "Narnia, Narnia, Narnia, awake" and started a magical place in the first book. In the second book, he helps win the fight against King Miras. In the third book, he saves prince Cor from his enemies and guides him to his destination. In the fourth book, he leads an invasion against the Telemarines. In the fifth book, he shows Repicheep the way back to his country. In the sixth book, he succesfully brings Eustace and Jill into Narnia. He can be found in all of the books. In the last book, all of the magical animals lose faith that Aslan is even there anymore. Later, Aslan squeezes the Sun and everything becomes cold, to reveal that the Narnia thought to be real, was just an illusion and only those who truly have faith would be allowed to cross the doors.</p>
